Step 2 : Intercept with BurpSuite, and insert some basic payload like " '%2b(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a)%2b' " and monitor the response. the sceenshot below shows the server have returns the response after 5 seconds , it seems we can move abit deeper :-) .

Step 3 : what if we save this into a burp file and pass it to sqlmap? The screenahot below shows the result of sqkmap.

Step 4 : We can expand abit more with below sqlmap command, i choose sql-shell . The screenshot below shown we can even execute sql command by abusing the vulnerable parameter.

Ps : Above steps is just POC for vendor, actually i have climb from sql-shell to fully OS command shell, but this may need more and more steps and technique involved and i think this is beyond what CVE request us to demo . 

Screenshot below show the version of HotelDruid
